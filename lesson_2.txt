How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

  Staging area acts as a bridge between the working directory and the repository, which allows users to add multiple files to it and bundle to create a single commit. It imposes more control on consistency between files when the content are correlated

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

  We can add the modified files to the staging area and compare the difference between the latest commit and the staging area to make sure the difference consists of only 1 logical change.
  If not, we can reset the staging area and add only the modified file(s) that contain only 1 logical change before we commit it to the repository.
